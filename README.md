# BlackHat USA 2025 Security Training

This is the Supply-Chain section for the [Theory and Practice: Machine Learning Security Threats and Vulnerabilities (Zero to Hero)](https://www.blackhat.com/us-25/training/schedule/#theory-and-practice-machine-learning-security-threats-and-vulnerabilities-zero-to-hero-44500) hosted in Las Vegas 2-5 Aug 2025.

## Skills required

Virtually none. If you have not coded in a while, you can still follow the workshop. All hands-on activities have code that is ready to be run. 
All you'll need to do is clone repositories, update configurations and click GitHub buttons or run commands in a terminal to follow along.
